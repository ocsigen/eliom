=@@id="server_generating_html"@@Generating HTML pages=

Ocsigen provides several ways to generate and type HTML5 pages.

* The default technique to produce HTML5 pages using Eliom is the
   <<a_api | module Eliom_content.Html5.F >> and
   <<a_api | module Eliom_content.Html5.D >>
   module. It is the only one supported for client side Eliom programs.
   This module provides a typing based on OCaml's polymorphic variants,
   which ensures at compile time, that the pages you will generate will
   respect the recommendations of the W3C (or be very close).
* It is also possible to use a syntax extension to write your pages with the
  usual HTML syntax. This solution is also typed with polymorphic variants
  and is compatible with the previous one.
* You can also choose to generate untyped html as text.

The types in OCaml closest to XML types are //polymorphic variants//.
Ocsigen uses them to provide a module with very good HTML5 typing.
The full documentation is available
<<a_api text="in the TyXML documentation" project="tyxml" | module Html5.M >>.

== Generating HTML for Eliom applications

=== The TyXML library vs. the DOM API

On client side there are two kinds of HTML representations: one is
based on the <<a_manual project="tyxml"|TyXML library>> and the other
one is the browser DOM tree accessible through Js_of_ocaml modules
<<a_api project="js_of_ocaml"| module Dom>> and <<a_api
project="js_of_ocaml"| module Dom_html>>. The TyXML representation is
a OCaml immutable typed tree. The DOM tree is mutable structure
manipulated using the browser API which permit the modification of the
displayed page. In the DOM represention adding a node as a child to an
other node removes it from its previous ancessor.

Since those representation does not behave at all the same way, they
are not used for the same thing.

* It is far easier and safer to describe content using TyXML, but it
   is not possible to add a TyXML element to the page without explicit
   conversion to the DOM representation.

* The TyXML representation has the same interface on client and server
  side. This allows share code between server and client.

* Dom manipulation is heavy: to build some part of a tree, one needs
  to create each node separately then append them to their parents.

For example, here is a {{{div}}} element build with TyXML and then
converted to the DOM representation using the module << a_api
subproject="client" | module Eliom_client.Html5 >>:

<<code language="ocaml"|
open Eliom_content.Html5.D
let n = div ~a:[a_id "some div id"]
  [ pcdata "some text";
    br ();
    pcdata "some other text"; ]
let b = Eliom_client.Html5.of_div n
>>

And here the same build using the DOM API:

<<code language="ocaml"|
open Dom
open Dom_html

let d = createDiv document in
let t1 = document##createTextNode( Js.string "some text" ) in
let t2 = document##createTextNode( Js.string "some other text" ) in
let b = createB document in
  appendChild d t1;
  appendChild d b;
  appendChild d t2;
  d##id <- (Js.string "some div id");
  d
>>

To ease the DOM manipulation on the client, the usual DOM manipulation
function are also available on TyXML elements. See section the next
section for HTML5 element manipulation, by value and by reference.

===@@id="unique"@@ HTML5 element manipulation, by value and by reference

When defining a service that returns an HTML5 page with Eliom we
usually use the module {{{Eliom_content.Html5.F}}}. When programming client/server
application with Eliom, we usualy prefer to use the module
{{{Eliom_content.Html5.D}}}. This is because
elements build with {{{Eliom_content.Html5.D}}} are sent to the client by
reference while elements build with {{{Eliom_content.Html5.F}}} are sent by value.

Sending elements by reference allows easy manipulation of elements
included in the initial html document from event handlers, as the
{{{input}}} element in the following example.

<<code language="ocaml"|
let main_service =
  My_appl.register_service ~path:[""] ~get_params:Eliom_parameter.unit
    (fun () () ->
       let open Eliom_content.Html5.D in
       let input = input ~a:[a_input_type `Text] () in
       let onclick_handler =
	 {{ let v =
	      Js.to_string (Eliom_client.Html5.of_input %input)##value
	    in
	    Dom_html.window##alert(Js.string ("Input value :" ^ v)) }}
       in
       let button =
         button ~a:[a_onclick onclick_handler] [pcdata "Read value"]
       in
       Lwt.return
         (html
	    (head (title (pcdata "Test")) [])
            (body [input; button]) ) )
>>

In this example, if the input button would have been incorrectly sent
by value, two different input fields would have been created: one
displayed in the document and one referenced from the event
handler. The latter will always contains an empty value.

There is still two situations where sending elements by value is still
required:

* one want to have multiple occurences of the same elements in the
  document. Indeed, elements sent by reference follow the DOM
  semantics where an element have only one instance in current
  document. For example, the following list will contains a single
  element:\\ \\ {{{let li = li [pcdata "Shared item"] in ul [li; li; li;] }}}.

* one have a large page with a lot elements. Handling elements by
  references add a small overhead while loading the page, around 50ms
  per 1000 elements on a not so fast computer.

In every case, it is possible to mix elements sent by references and
elements sent by value in the same document.

The module <<a_api subproject="client"| module Eliom_dom >> allows
using the classical DOM manipulation functions (e.g. appendChild,
addEventlistener, ...) directly on HTML5 elements that follow the DOM
semantics.

By default, a reference on an element is only valid in the current
HTTP request: hence, sending an element build with {{{Eliom_content.Html5.D}}} in
two different page will produce two distinct nodes. If you want to
define a element reference that is preserved accross the different
page of an application, you must explicitely name this element with
the function <<a_api subproject="server" | val
Eliom_content.Html5.Id.create_named_elt >>, that take as parameters an
element identifier and a non named element.  Element identifiers are
created with the function <<a_api subproject="server" | val
Eliom_content.Html5.Id.new_elt_id >>. See also section <<a_manual
chapter="clientserver-applications" fragment="global" |Global elements of an
application>>.

The module <<a_api subproject="client"| module Eliom_content.Html5.Manip >>
allows using the classical DOM manipulation functions
(e.g. appendChild, addEventlistener, ...) directly on the identifier
of an HTML5 elements.

===@@id="global"@@Global elements of an application

Sometimes you may want to modify the content of an HTML element and to
keep the element and its modified content when changing page. For
examplem a {{{div}}} element which contains a chat box or a music
player should be preserved while browsing across the different page of
your site. For purpose Eliom provides a notion of global element. Such
elements are instantied only once for an application and that unique
instance is used in every page that references the element.

You could create a global element with the function <<a_api
subproject="client" text="Eliom_content.Html5.Id.create_global_elt"| val
Eliom_content.Html5.Id.create_global_elt >>.

<<code language="ocaml"|
val create_global_elt: 'a elt -> 'a elt
>>

In the following example, the content of {{{global_list}}} will be
preserved when you click on the "reload page" link.

<<code language="ocaml"|
{shared{
open Eliom_content.Html5.D
}}

let global_list = create_global_elt (ul [])
let cpt = ref 0

let main_service =
  Eliom_service.service
    ~path:[""] ~get_params:Eliom_parameter.unit
    ()

let reload_link =
  a ~service:main_service [pcdata "reload page"] ()

let _ =
  My_appl.register ~service:main_service
    (fun () () ->
       let page_number = incr cpt; string_of_int !cpt in
       let append_item =
	 {{ let item_text = "item inserted in page #" ^ %page_number in
	    let item = Eliom_client.Html5.of_li (li [pcdata item_text]) in
	    Dom.appendChild (Eliom_client.Html5.of_ul %global_list) item }}
       in
       let append_link =
         a ~a:[a_onclick append_item] [pcdata "append item"]
       in
       Lwt.return
         (html
	    (head (title (pcdata "Test")) [])
            (body [h1 [pcdata ("Page #" ^ page_number)];
	           p [append_link];
		   p [reload_link];
		   global_list]) ) )
>>

Another use of global element is for external javascript that should
be included in every page but must be executed only once in an
application. In the following code snippet, the alert "global script"
is displayed only once, while the alert "non global script" is display
every time you click on the "reload page" link.

<<code language="ocaml"|
open Eliom_content.Html5.D

let global_script =
  create_global_elt
    (script (cdata_script "alert(\"global script\")"))
let simple_script =
     script (cdata_script "alert(\"non global script\")")

let main_service =
  Eliom_service.service
     ~path:[] ~get_params:Eliom_parameter.unit ()

let reload_link =
  a ~service:main_service [pcdata "reload page"] ()

let _ = My_appl.register ~service:main_service
  (fun () () ->
    Lwt.return
      (html
         (head
	   (title (pcdata "Global script example"))
	   [ global_script;
	     simple_script ])
         (body
	   [ p [reload_link] ])))
>>

=== HTML syntax extension===

Ocsigen also has a syntax extension for OCaml that allows you to write
pages using HTML syntax (but you are free not to use it).  This is
convenient for example if you want to include (parts of) HTML pages
that have been created by third party.  To choose actual
XML-implementation you have to provide a module named ##Html5##
(or ##Svg## respectively):

For example, the following code:
<<code language="ocaml"|
module Html5 = Html5.M (* NB this is TyXML's Html5; could also be Eliom_content.Html5.F *)

<< <html>
     <head><title></title></head>
     <body><h1>plop</h1></body>
   </html> ~>>
>>
is a caml value of type {{{Html5_types.html Html5.M.elt}}}.

To compile a module containing this syntax, you need the camlp4 preprocessor:
{{{
ocamlc -I /path_to/ocsigen/
 -pp "camlp4o /path_to/ocsigen/xhtmlsyntax.cma -loc loc"
 -c your_module.ml
}}}

You can insert OCaml expressions of type {{{'a Html5.M.elt}}} inside
html using {{{$...$}}}, like this:

<<code language="ocaml"|
let oc = << <em>Ocsigen</em> >> in
<< <p>$oc$ will revolutionize web programming.</p> ~>>
>>

<<wip| remove \ before $, _ in code, everywhere in pdf version!!!!!!!!!! >>

You can insert OCaml expressions of type string inside html
using ##$str:... $##, like this:

<<code language="ocaml"|
let i = 4 in
<< <p>i is equal to $str:string_of_int i$</p> ~>>
>>

If you want to use a dollar in your page, just write it twice.

You can write a list of HTML5 expressions using the syntax {{{<:xmllist<...>>}}}, for example:
<<code language="ocaml"|
<:html5list< <p>hello</p> <div></div> ~>>
>>
Here are some other examples showing what you can do:
<<code language="ocaml"|
<< <ul class=$ulclass$ $list:other_attrs$>
     $first_il$
     $list:items$
   </ul> ~>>
>>

Warning: lists antiquotations are allowed only at the end (before a
closing tag). For example, the following is not valid:

<<code language="ocaml"|
<< <ul $list:other_attrs$ class=$ulclass$>
     $list:items$
     $last_il$
   </ul> ~>>
>>

The syntax extension is not allowed in patterns for now.

//Warning:// The two syntaxes are not equivalent for typing.  Using
the syntax extension will do less checking.  For example the following
code is accepted but not valid regarding HTML5 standard (because
<<span class="code"|<head>>> must contain a title):

<<code language="ocaml"|
  << <html>
     <head></head>
     <body><h1>plop</h1></body>
   </html> ~>>
>>

We recommend you use the functions from <<a_api project="tyxml" |
module Eliom_content.Html5.D>>, as you will (almost) always get valid
HTML5. Use the syntax extension for example to enclose already created
pieces of HTML, and check your pages validity with the
[[http://validator.w3.org/| W3C validator]].


===Text HTML===

The last possibility is to use untyped HTML. Just build strings
containing your pages. Here is an example:

<<code language="ocaml"|
let coucoutext =
  Eliom_registration.Html_text.register_service
    ~path:["coucoutext"]
    ~get_params:Eliom_parameter.unit
    (fun () () ->
      Lwt.return
        ("<html>n'importe quoi "^
         (Eliom_content.Html_text.a coucou "clic" ())^
         "</html>"))
>>

===@@id="custom_data"@@Custom data for HTML5===

Eliom provides a type-safe interface for using HTML5's custom data, <<a_api | module
Eliom_content.Html5.Custom_data>>.

==== Creation ====
Custom data may be created either from string-conversation functions by <<a_api | val
Eliom_content.Html5.Custom_data.create>>

<<code language="ocaml"|
open Eliom_content
type my_int_data =
  Html5.Custom_data.create ~name:"my_int" ~of_string:int_of_string ~to_string:string_of_int ()
>>

or by a Json-deriving type <<a_api | val Eliom_content.Html5.Custom_data.create_json>>

<<code language="ocaml"|
{shared{
  type coord = { x : int; y : int; } deriving (Json)
  let coord_data =
    Html5.Custom_data.create_json ~name:"coord" Json.t<coord>
}} >>

==== Injecting ====

Custom data can be injected into HTML5-trees of type <<a_api
project="eliom"|type Eliom_content.Html5.elt>> by the function <<a_api
project="eliom"|val Eliom_content.Html5.Custom_data.attrib>>:

<<code language="ocaml"|
  div ~a:[Html5.Custom_data.attrib coord_data {x = 100; y = 200}] []
>>

NB, HTML5 gives no restriction on the usage of custom data, any custom data can
may be added to //any// HTML5 element.

==== Reading/writing the DOM ====

On the client side, custom data can be read from and written to JavaScript DOM
elements of type <<a_api project="js_of_ocaml"|class type Dom_html.element>>.

Custom data can be read from a DOM-element with the function
<<a_api subproject="client"|val Eliom_content.Html5.Custom_data.get_dom>>.
If no respective custom data attribute can be found in the element
 * the ##default## value from creating the custom data is returned, if any, or
 * an exception ##Not_found## is raised, otherwise.

The custom data of a DOM-element can be set with the function
<<a_api subproject="client"|val Eliom_content.Html5.Custom_data.set_dom>>.

<<code language="ocaml"|
  {client{
    fun (div : Dom_html.element Js.t) ->
      let i = Html5.Custom_data.get_dom div coord_data in
      debug "{x=%d; y=%d}" i.x i.y;
      Html5.Custom_data.set_dom div coord_data { x = i.x + 1; y = i.y - 1 }
  }}
>>

==== Default value ====
If a custom data is created with the optional argument ##default##, calls to
<<a_api subproject="client" | val
Eliom_content.Html5.Custom_data.get_dom>> return that instead of throwing an
exception [Not_found].

<<code language="ocaml"|
  let coord_data' =
    Html5.Custom_data.create_json ~name:"coord" default:{x=0;y=0;} Json.t<my_data>
>>
