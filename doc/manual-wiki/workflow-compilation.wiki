=Compiling client-server Eliom applications

The build process for client-server Eliom applications is rather
tricky. To ease development of such application, we recommend you to
create your project with <<a_manual
chapter="workflow-distillery"|Eliom's distillery>>: It contains a
Makefile with rules for compiling, testing, installing, and running.

This chapter, however, gives a bit more overview on the compilation
process.

==@@id="compilation"@@ Compilation overview

Here is first of all a small overview of the compilation
process of a (single file) Eliom program. The source code of an Eliom
application is stored in a file with the extension ##.eliom##. In this
manner, it is detected by the Eliom compilers, ##eliomc## and ##js_of_eliom##.
The compilation of an eliom program is carried out in three steps.

First, necessary type information of the server program is extracted
from the source code by ##eliomc -infer##. This information is
necessary for the actual compilation of the client and server
program. It is typically stored in a file ##_server/program.type_mli##
for an Eliom module in a file ##program.eliom##.

Secondly, the server program (or rather, the library to be dynamically
loaden into the Ocsigen server) is compiled by the program ##eliomc -c##.
It filters the source code for the parts relevant to the server
and compiles it against the libraries available server. The resulting
bytecode object file is stored in ##_server/program.type_mli## by default.

Thirdly, the client program is compiled by ##js_of_eliom##. It filters
the source code for the parts relevant for the client program and
compiles it against the libraries available for client.  The
program ##js_of_eliom -c## creates a bytecode object file (stored
in ##_client/program.cmo## by default) and ##js_of_eliom -o program.js##
is used to actually compile and link the //JavaScript// program to run on
the client.

So much for the compilation process, here comes what you gain from
Eliom for the integrated development of client/server applications.


==Using {{{eliomc}}} and {{{js_of_eliom}}}

The easiest way to build a client-server Eliom application is to used
the scripts {{{eliomc}}} and {{{js_of_eliom}}}. Those scripts are
basic wrappers around {{{ocamlfind}}}, {{{ocamlc}}} and
{{{js_of_ocaml}}}.

You can compile your application with the following two commands:

{{{
eliomc -a -o appl.cma server_module.ml appl.eliom ...
js_of_eliom -o appl.js client_module.ml appl.eliom ...
}}}

The first command compile the server-specific part of the
application. The second one compile the client-specific part. Each
command accept multiple {{{.ml}}} and {{{.eliom}}} files.

Temporary files will be written in the {{{_server}}} and
{{{_client}}} directory. Those directory may be changed with command
line option of the environment variable {{{ELIOM_SERVER_DIR}}} and
{{{ELIOM_CLIENT_DIR}}}.

Those commands accepts the same set of arguments as {{{ocamlc}}}, plus
the following specific options:

* {{{-package}}} is the same to the {{{ocamlfind}}} option.
* {{{-predicates <p>}}} is the same to the {{{ocamlfind}}} option.
* {{{-no-autoload}}} Do not load commonly used syntax extensions
  (deriving, lwt, js_of_ocaml, tyxml).
* {{{-type-conv}}} Use type_conv syntax extensions instead of deriving
  one. It has no effect if used in conjunction with {{{-no-autoload}}}.
* {{{-dir <dir>}}} set default directory for temporary files.
* {{{-jsopt <opt>}}} pass {{{opt}}} to the {{{js_of_ocaml}}} compiler **{{{js_of_eliom}}} only**

If you want to use the native version of ocsigen server, you may
replace {{{eliomc}}} by {{{eliomopt}}}.


==Using {{{ocamlbuild}}} (ocaml >= 4.01 and eliom >= 4 only)

{{{ocamlbuild}}} is a standard tool for building ocaml programs and libraries.
It contains a powerful plugin system which has been improved in ocaml 4.01 by
the {{{-plugin-tags}}} option. This option allows you to give tags to the plugin
itself and to (for example) use some libraries. In fact, the best usage is to
import libraries that are ocamlbuild plugins.

eliom has now an ocamlbuild plugin contained in the package {{{eliom.ocamlbuild}}}.
This plugin allows to compile .eliom files and to create javascript executables.

To compile an eliom project or library with ocamlbuild, you need to add this
to your {{{myocamlbuild.ml}}} (at the root of your project):

<<code language="ocaml"|
module M = Ocamlbuild_eliom.Make(struct
  let client_dir = "client"
  let server_dir = "server"
  let type_dir = "type"
end)

let () = Ocamlbuild_plugin.dispatch M.dispatcher
>>
(if you are using OASIS, see also the next section)

The {{{client_dir}}} {{{server_dir}}} and {{{type_dir}}} values are the
directories that are used for client server and type parts.
The plugin will dispatch the .eliom in three .ml files in server, client and type
dir. Those three dir will be concatenated to the current directory.
For example, if you have {{{test.eliom}}} in src, it will be dispatched in
src/server/test.ml, src/client/test.ml and src/type/test.ml
(same for .eliomi files).
Don't forget to mention the good one in your .mllib file
(for a server lib, it will be {{{src/server/Test}}}).

Then in a file named {{{_tags}}} (at the root of your project), add:

{{{
true: thread, syntax(camlp4o)
}}}

You can and probably should replace {{{true}}} by certain specific pattern
(see: [[https://github.com/gasche/manual-ocamlbuild/blob/master/manual.md#tags-and-the-_tags-file]])
that effectively use a camlp4 syntax extention (other that your eliom files).
Dependencies are added with {{{package(yourdep)}}} in the same line.

For libraries, don't forget to add the corresponding .mllib file.
Then, you can compile your project with:

{{{
ocamlbuild -use-ocamlfind -plugin-tags "package(eliom.ocamlbuild)" \
    yourlib.cma yourlib.cmxa yourlib.cmxs yourexecutable.js
}}}


==Using {{{ocamlbuild and OASIS}}} (ocaml >= 4.01 and eliom >= 4 only)

After having created the _oasis with the corresponding Library and Executable
sections, please read the above selection on ocamlbuild.
You don't need to create the .mllib since it's auto-generated.
Dependencies are also handled by OASIS.

Your {{{_oasis}}} file should look like this:
{{{
OASISFormat: 0.4
Name: your-application
Version: 1.0
Synopsis: a description
Authors: You
License: MIT
AlphaFeatures: ocamlbuild_more_args, compiled_setup_ml

OCamlVersion: >= 4.01

Library "yourapp"
  Path: src
  Modules:
    server/AnEliomFile, # the .eliom files are in fact located in src
# but specifying server/ is nececary for knowing that it is the server
# part we include here
    Amodule # .ml modules are refered normally as simple modules
  BuildDepends:
    eliom.server,
    andotherdep
  DataFiles:
    ../_build/src/client/yourprogram.js # If you want to install the .js

Executable "yourprogram"
  Install: false # We usally don't want to install the .byte
  Path: src/client
  MainIs: yourprogram.ml # the main file. It should refere to every modules
# you use for this program (.eliom included)
  BuildDepends:
    eliom.client
  CompiledObject: byte # because a js executable only needs the bytecode
}}}

If you want to use OASIS, the dispatch call should looks like this:

<<code language="ocaml"|
let () =
  Ocamlbuild_plugin.dispatch
    (fun hook ->
       dispatch_default hook;
       M.dispatcher
         ~oasis_executables:["src/client/theprogram.byte"]
         hook;
    )
>>

If you don't need a javascript executable, you can remove the line with {{{~oasis_executables}}}
(like for a library that contains .eliom files for example).

Be careful to always add those parts after the OASIS END block.

==[EXPERIMENTAL] Using {{{eliomdoc}}} and {{{eliompp}}}
You can use {{{eliomdoc}}} to generate the documentation of your project.
{{{eliompp}}} is a preprocessor which deletes specific sections ({{{{shared{}}},
{{{{client{}}} and {{{{server{}}}), depending on the first parameter
({{{-client}}} or {{{-server}}}).

We use a hand made preprocessor
because **camlp4** doesn't handle commentaries during preprocessing,
so it was not possible to extract commentaries of a specific section.

{{{eliomdoc}}} handle the same options as {{{ocamldoc}}}.
It is only a wrapper around it (as {{{eliomc}}} for {{{ocamlc}}}).

{{{eliompp}}} prints on the standard output the preprocessed file.
So if you use it with {{{-client}}}, it will prints {{{{shared{}}} and {{{{client{}}} sections.

You can use them like this:
{{{
eliompp -client foobar.eliom ...
eliompp -server foobar.eliom ...

eliomdoc -client -d doc/client -html foobar.eliom ...
eliomdoc -server -d doc/server -html foobar.eliom ...
}}}

Here are some known bugs with {{{eliomdoc}}}:
* Your files should always **begin with a value** and **not with a comment**. Otherwise,
camlp4 won't output the commentaries.
* Sometimes, comment node **are not attached as expected**. That's because
camlp4 (sometimes) remove extra new line between value elements.
