=Compiling client-server Eliom applications

The build process for client-server Eliom applications is rather
involved. To ease development of such application, we recommend you to
create your project with <<a_manual
chapter="workflow-distillery"|Eliom's distillery>>: this provides a
Makefile with rules for compiling, testing, installing, and running
you project.

This chapter provides more details on the compilation
process.

==@@id="compilation"@@ Compilation overview

We first give a small overview of the compilation
process of a (single file) Eliom program. The source code of an Eliom
application should be stored in a file with extension ##.eliom##, so as to
be recognized by the Eliom compilers, ##eliomc## and ##js_of_eliom##.
The compilation of an eliom program is carried out in three steps.

First, type information is extracted from the server part of the program
by ##eliomc -infer##. This information is
necessary for the actual compilation of the client- and server-side
code. For an Eliom module in a file ##program.eliom##,
the information is typically stored in a file ##_server/program.type_mli##

Second, the server part of the program (or more precisely,
the library dynamically
loaded into the Ocsigen server) is compiled by ##eliomc -c##.
The server source code is extracted and
and compiled against the libraries available server-side. The resulting
bytecode object file is stored by default in ##_server/program.cmo##.

Third, the client program is compiled by ##js_of_eliom##. The client
source code is extracted and compiled against the client-side libraries.
The program ##js_of_eliom -c## creates a bytecode object file (stored
in ##_client/program.cmo## by default) and ##js_of_eliom -o program.js##
is used to actually compile and link the //JavaScript// program to be run on
the client.

==Using {{{eliomc}}} and {{{js_of_eliom}}}

The easiest way to build a client-server Eliom application is to use
{{{eliomc}}} and {{{js_of_eliom}}}. Those tools are
wrappers around {{{ocamlfind}}}, {{{ocamlc}}} and
{{{js_of_ocaml}}}.

You can compile your application with the two following commands:

{{{
eliomc -a -o appl.cma server_module.ml appl.eliom ...
js_of_eliom -o appl.js client_module.ml appl.eliom ...
}}}

The first command compiles the server-specific part of the
application. The second one compiles the client-specific part. Each
command accept multiple {{{.ml}}} and {{{.eliom}}} files.

Temporary files are written in the {{{_server}}} and
{{{_client}}} directory. These directories may be changed through
a command line option, or the environment variables {{{ELIOM_SERVER_DIR}}} and
{{{ELIOM_CLIENT_DIR}}}.

These commands accept the same set of arguments as {{{ocamlc}}}, plus
the following specific options:

* {{{-package}}} is the same as the corresponding {{{ocamlfind}}} option.
* {{{-predicates <p>}}} is the same as the {{{ocamlfind}}} option.
* {{{-no-autoload}}} Do not load commonly used syntax extensions
  (deriving, lwt, js_of_ocaml, tyxml).
* {{{-type-conv}}} Use the type_conv syntax extension instead of the deriving
  one. It has no effect when used in conjunction with {{{-no-autoload}}}.
* {{{-dir <dir>}}} set the default directory for temporary files.
* {{{-jsopt <opt>}}} pass {{{opt}}} to the {{{js_of_ocaml}}} compiler **{{{js_of_eliom}}} only**

If you want to use the native version of the ocsigen server, you should
replace {{{eliomc}}} by {{{eliomopt}}}.


==Using {{{ocamlbuild}}} (ocaml >= 4.01 and eliom >= 4 only)

{{{ocamlbuild}}} is a standard tool for building ocaml programs and libraries.
It contains a powerful plugin system which has been improved in ocaml 4.01 by
the {{{-plugin-tags}}} option. This option allows you to give tags to the plugin
itself, for example to use some libraries. In fact, the best usage is to
import libraries that are ocamlbuild plugins.

eliom has now an ocamlbuild plugin contained in the package {{{eliom.ocamlbuild}}}.
This plugin allows to compile .eliom files and to create javascript executables.

To compile an eliom project or library with ocamlbuild, you need to add this
to your {{{myocamlbuild.ml}}} (at the root of your project):

<<code language="ocaml"|
module M = Ocamlbuild_eliom.Make(struct
  let client_dir = "client"
  let server_dir = "server"
  let type_dir = "type"
end)

let () = Ocamlbuild_plugin.dispatch M.dispatcher
>>

The {{{client_dir}}}, {{{server_dir}}} and {{{type_dir}}} values are
directories (relative the location of each eliom file) that are used for
client, server and type parts.  The plugin will dispatch the {{{.eliom}}} in
three {{{.ml}}} files in server, client and type
dir, from which {{{ocamlbuild}}} can eventually create {{{.cma}}} or {{{.js}}}
files.  For example, if you have {{{test.eliom}}} in {{{./src/}}}, it will be
dispatched to {{{./_build/src/server/test.ml}}},
{{{./_build/src/client/test.ml}}} and {{{./_build/src/type/test.ml}}} (same for
{{{.eliomi}}} files).  Don't forget to mention the good one in your
{{{.mllib}}} file (for a server lib, it will be {{{src/server/Test}}}).

Then in a file named {{{_tags}}} (at the root of your project), add:

{{{
<server/*>: package(eliom.server), package(yourserverdep), thread
<client/*>: package(eliom.client), package(yourclientdep)
true: package(yourlibdeps)
}}}

See
[[https://github.com/ocaml/ocamlbuild/blob/master/manual/manual.adoc#tags-and-the-code-_tags-code-file]]
for more details.  In some cases, {{{syntax(camlp4o}}} is needed, and in newer
versions of Eliom, {{{package(eliom.server)}}} and {{{package(eliom.client)}}}
may be omitted.  Dependencies are added with {{{package(yourdep)}}} on the
same line.

By default, our {{{ocamlbuild}}} plugin uses the
<<a_manual chapter="clientserver-language"|Camlp4 syntax extension>>.
To use <<a_manual chapter="ppx-syntax"|PPX>>, you can set the
{{{eliom_ppx}}} flag in {{{_tags}}}, as follows:

{{{
<*.eliom>: eliom_ppx
<*.eliomi>: eliom_ppx
}}}

For libraries, don't forget to add the corresponding .mllib file.
Then, you can compile your project with:

{{{
ocamlbuild -use-ocamlfind -plugin-tags "package(eliom.ocamlbuild)" \
    server/yoursite.cma server/yoursite.cmxa server/yoursite.cmxs \
    yourlib.cma yourlib.cmxa yourlib.cmxs \
    client/yoursite.js
}}}

This creates the {{{server/yoursite.cma}}} and {{{client/yoursite.js}}}
files required by {{{ocsigenserver}}} inside {{{_build}}}.

==Using {{{OASIS}}} (ocaml >= 4.01)

Here follows a simple way to set up an OASIS environment that supports Eliom.

Your {{{_oasis}}} file should look like this:
{{{
OASISFormat: 0.4
Name: <fill>
Version: <fill>
Synopsis: <fill>
Authors: <fill>
License: <fill>
AlphaFeatures: ocamlbuild_more_args, compiled_setup_ml
Plugins: DevFiles (0.4)
BuildTools: ocamlbuild
XOCamlbuildPluginTags: package(eliom.ocamlbuild)
OCamlVersion: >= 4.01
PostBuildCommand: cp _build/src/client/app.js static/

Library "server"
  Path: src
  Modules: server/Main
  BuildDepends: eliom.server

Executable "client"
  Install: false
  Path: src
  MainIs: client/app.ml
  BuildDepends: eliom.client, js_of_ocaml.ppx, lwt_ppx
  CompiledObject: byte
}}}

* The *.eliom modules have to be prefixed by {{{server/}}}. All your source
files must be placed in the {{{src}}} directory (NOT in {{{src/server}}});
* The server parts of the {{{*.eliom}}} files in {{{src}}} will be added in
{{{src/server}}} because of the dispatcher we will install just after;
* The client parts will go to {{{src/client}}};
* The {{{src/client/app.ml}}} file should just open every module required for
the client part (including all {{{*.eliom}}} modules);
* This setup uses the PPX extension points (not camlp4);
* The client bytecode does not need to be installed, we are only interrested in
the {{{app.js}}} file generated.

Replace the default dispatcher at the end of {{{myocamlbuild.ml}}} by the
following (after OASIS_STOP):
{{{code language="ocaml"|
module M = Ocamlbuild_eliom.Make (struct
  let client_dir = "client"
  let server_dir = "server"
  let type_dir = "type"
end)

let () =
  Ocamlbuild_plugin.dispatch
  (fun hook ->
    dispatch_default hook;
    M.dispatcher ~oasis_executables:["src/client/app.byte"] hook)
}}}

The following configuration has to be added at the end of the {{{_tags}}} file:
{{{
<**/*.eliom{,i}>: eliom_ppx
<src/{server,type}/*.ml{,i}>: thread
"src/client/app.js": package(eliom.client)
}}}

Finally, in order to run your server, you need a configuration file (here we
name it {{{run.conf}}}) like:
{{{
<ocsigen>
  <server>
    <port>8080</port>

    <logdir>local/var/log/projectname</logdir>
    <datadir>local/var/data/projectname</datadir>
    <charset>utf-8</charset>

    <commandpipe>local/var/run/projectname-cmd</commandpipe>
    <extension findlib-package="ocsigenserver.ext.staticmod"/>
    <extension findlib-package="ocsigenserver.ext.ocsipersist-sqlite"/>
    <extension findlib-package="eliom.server"/>

    <host hostfilter="*">
      <static dir="static" />
      <static dir="local/var/www/projectname/eliom" />
      <eliommodule module="_build/src/server.cma" />
      <eliom/>
    </host>
  </server>
</ocsigen>
}}}
Don't forget to create any necessary directory.

You should now be able to compile and run your website on {{{localhost:8080}}}
using:

{{{
oasis setup
ocaml setup.ml -configure
ocaml setup.ml -build
ocsigenserver -c run.conf
}}}

==[EXPERIMENTAL] Using {{{eliomdoc}}} and {{{eliompp}}}
You can use {{{eliomdoc}}} to generate the documentation of your project.
{{{eliompp}}} is a preprocessor which deletes specific sections ({{{{shared{}}},
{{{{client{}}} and {{{{server{}}}), depending on the first parameter
({{{-client}}} or {{{-server}}}).

We use a hand made preprocessor
because **camlp4** doesn't handle comments during preprocessing,
so it is not possible to extract comments of a specific section.

{{{eliomdoc}}} handle the same options as {{{ocamldoc}}}.
It is only a wrapper around it (as {{{eliomc}}} for {{{ocamlc}}}).

{{{eliompp}}} prints on the standard output the preprocessed file.
So if you use it with {{{-client}}}, it will prints {{{{shared{}}} and {{{{client{}}} sections.

You can use them as follows:
{{{
eliompp -client foobar.eliom ...
eliompp -server foobar.eliom ...

eliomdoc -client -d doc/client -html foobar.eliom ...
eliomdoc -server -d doc/server -html foobar.eliom ...
}}}

Here are some known bugs with {{{eliomdoc}}}:
* Your files should always **begin with a value** and **not with a comment**. Otherwise,
camlp4 won't output the comments.
* Sometimes, comment nodes **are not attached where expected**. That's because
camlp4 (sometimes) remove extra newlines between value elements.
