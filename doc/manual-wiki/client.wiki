=Programming client-server applications with Eliom

<<div class="wip"| See the [[site:tutorial|tutorial]] . >>

== General principles
=== What is a client/server Eliom application

An Eliom application is a distributed application that runs partly on the
server, partly on a browser. The program is fully written in OCaml, with
a syntax extension to distinguish between server and client code.
Both parts are extracted during the compilation process, the server part
is compiled as usual for an Eliom website, and the client part is compiled
to Javascript to be run in the browser.

An intersting feature of Eliom applications is that the client side process
does not stop when you click on a link or send a form, and it is possible to
keep the traditional Web interaction (with URLs, bookmarks, back button, etc).
For example if the page is playing music, it won't stop when the user continue
his visit on the Web site.

Client side parts are using {{{Lwt}}} for concurrency, making possible
to have concurrent programs in the browser very easily.

As both part are implemented in OCaml, it is very easy to use client side
OCaml data on server side, and vice-versa. Eliom handle the communication
between client and server automatically in both direction. For example
it possible to use a server-side variable in the client program.

Eliom also implements an "HTTP-push" mechanism, allowing the server
to send messages to a client.

Client-side parts of the program can use most Eliom features, exactly
as usual, for example to create HTML, or links, forms from services.

On server side, it is possible to save data (some state) for each client
process (that is, one tab in a browser),
simply by using Eliom references with scope {{{`Client_process}}}.
You can register services for one client process, or even set cookies
for one tab.

=== How it works

The code of an Eliom application is written in OCaml, with a syntax extension
to distinguish between server and client code. The files using this syntax
usually have the extension {{{.eliom}}}. As the compling process is quite
complex, we provide commands called {{{eliomc}}} and {{{js_of_eliom}}} that
does everything for you (separating client and server parts, calling
{{{ocamlc}}}, {{{js_of_ocaml}}}, etc).

Services belonging to the application are registered using the module
{{{Eliom_output.Eliom_appl}}}. More precisely, this is a functor that
needs to be applyed for each application you create.
These services just return HTML5 pages as usual (using {{{Tyxml.Html5}}} --
not possible with OcamlDuce or any other HTML module).
The client side program (compiled in JS) is added automatically by Eliom,
with all its data, and run automatically when the page is loaded.

The module {{{Eliom_client}}} provides some useful functions for client
side programming with Eliom: mainly switch to another page or call a service
returning some OCaml value.

The module {{{Eliom_comet}}} allows for the server to send notifications
to the client (even if the client is not explicitely doing a request).
The module {{{Eliom_react}}} use this to make client-server reactive
programming (using the React external library).


== Structure of a program
=== Syntax

Eliom application are written in files with extension {{{.eliom}}}.
Some special brackets make possible to distinuish between client and server
code:
<<code language="ocaml"|
{server{
  ...
}}
>>
or no brackets for server side code,
<<code language="ocaml"|
{client{
  ...
}}
>>
for client side code,
and
<<code language="ocaml"|
{shared{
  ...
}}
>>
for some code that is common to client and server parts.

Expressions of type {{{XML.event}}} (used for example in HTML attributes
like "onclick") are written using the quotation {{{ {{ ... }} }}}, for
example:
<<code language="ocaml"|
p ~a:[a_onclick {{ Dom_html.window##alert(Js.string "clicked!") }}]
  [pcdata "I am a clickable paragraph"]
>>

(The {{{##}}} syntax is js_of_ocaml's syntax for calling a Javascript method).

==== Using server side values on client side

Client code inside {{{ {{ ... }} }}} quotation can use server side value
using the {{{%variable}}} syntax: variables prefixed by {{{%}}} are sent to
the client along the content of the page.

for instance:
<<code language="ocaml"|
let value = 3 in
p ~a:[a_onclick {{ Dom_html.window##alert(Js.string ("value = " ^ (string_of_int %value))) }}]
  [pcdata "I am a clickable paragraph"]
>>

Notice that not all values are possible to send that way: since client and
server side representation are not the same, it is impossible to send
functions. This means that unforced lazy values, objects, or anything
containing functions can't be send. Some eliom types use a specific machanism
to circumvent this limitation. This is the case of: services, comet channels
and busses. To use this mechanism see <<wip| reference a la doc du wrapping >>.

Those values are typechecked "by name": the most general type of a variable is
inferred for server side then use as a type constraint on client side.
For instance
<<code language="ocaml"|
let value = [] in
let v = {{ %value }}
>>
can be read as
<<code language="ocaml"|
let value = [] in
let v = {{ (%value: _ list) }}
>>

As client an server code are compiled separately, this means that a code like
the following would be incorrect but would typecheck.
<<code language="ocaml"|
type a = A of int
{client{ type a = A of string }}
let value = A 1 in
let v = {{ match %value with A s -> Dom_html.window##alert(Js.string s) }}
>>

Note that for some reason, it is impossible to use the {{{ {...{ }} }}} and
{{{ {{ }} }}} syntax inside a module. For {{{ {{ }} }}} you can usually
circumvent this limitation by declaring a function at toplevel with all the
{{{%variable}}} as parameters.

=== The Eliom_appl functor

For each Eliom application, you must create a service registration module
by applying the {{{Eliom_appl}}} functor:

<<code language="ocaml"|
module My_appl =
  Eliom_output.Eliom_appl (
    struct
      let application_name = "the name of your application"
    end)
>>

the {{{application_name}}} parameter is the name of the javascript file
containing the application.

Then you can do for example:
<<code language="ocaml"|
let my_service =
  My_appl.register_service
    ~path:[""]
    ~get_params:unit
    (fun () () -> Lwt.return (html
                               (head (title (pcdata "Hi!")) [])
                               (body [p [pcdata "Hey."]])))
>>

Eliom will add automatically the required headers to send the client side
program and all its data.

=== Compiling

The compiling process for Eliom applications is explained on chapter ???????.

== Generating HTML for Eliom applications

On client side there are two kinds of HTML representations: Tyxml HTML tree and
the browser DOM. Tyxml representation is a Ocaml immutable typed tree. The DOM
tree is mutable structure manipulated using the browser API which permit the
modification of the displayed page. It is not a tree (node reference their
ancessor), adding a node as a child to an other node removes it from its
previous ancessor.

Since those representation does not behave at all the same way, they are not
used for the same thing.

 * it is far easier and safer ( typed ) to describe content using tyxml, but it
is not possible to add a tyxml node to the page directly. It has the same
interface on client and <<a_manual fragment="server_generating_html"| server side>>

 * Dom manipulation is heavy: to build some part of a tree, one needs to
create each node separately then append them to their parents.

Using HTML5:

<<code language="ocaml"|
open HTML5.M
let n = div ~a:[a_id "some div id"]
  [ pcdata "some text";
    br ();
    pcdata "some other text"; ]
>>

Using DOM:

<<code language="ocaml"|
open Dom
open Dom_html

let d = createDiv document in
let t1 = document##createTextNode( Js.string "some text" ) in
let t2 = document##createTextNode( Js.string "some other text" ) in
let b = createB document in
  appendChild d t1;
  appendChild d b;
  appendChild d t2;
  d##id <- (Js.string "some div id");
  d
>>

but converting from HTML5 to dom is possible:

<<code language="ocaml"|
open HTML5.M
let n = div ~a:[a_id "some div id"]
  [ pcdata "some text";
    br ();
    pcdata "some other text"; ]
let b = Eliom_client.Html5.of_div n
>>

will build exactly the same thing as the node build using dom functions.

=== HTML5 manipulation, by value and by reference

Notice that, since {{{ Eliom_client.Html5.of_div n }}} is building a new dom
node from a Tyxml tree, using
<<code language="ocaml"|
let b1 = Eliom_client.Html5.of_div n
let b2 = Eliom_client.Html5.of_div n
>>
{{{ b1 }}} and {{{ b2 }}} will be different nodes ( {{{ b1 == b2 }}} will be
{{{ false }}} ).

Which means that
<<code language="ocaml"|
let _ = My_appl.register_service ~path:[] ~get_params:unit
  (fun () () ->
    let div = HTML5.M.div [] in
    Eliom_services.onload {{
      Dom.appendChild
        (Eliom_client.Html5.of_div %div)
        (Dom_html.document##createTextNode(Js.string "some text"))
    }};
    Lwt.return
      (HTML5.M.html
         (HTML5.M.head (HTML5.M.title (HTML5.M.pcdata "title")) [])
         (HTML5.M.body [div])))
>>
won't work as expected: the page will remain blank. The node
{{{(Eliom_client.Html5.of_div %div)}}} is completely unrelated to {{{ div }}},
it is just a div node without parent.

To be able to do something similar, one needs to manipulate node 'by reference'
as opposed to 'by value' as we have seen until now.

To do that we use the <<a_api project="eliom" | val Eliom_pervasives.HTML5.M.unique >> function:
<<code language="ocaml"|
val unique: ?copy:'a elt -> 'a elt -> 'a elt
>>
It create a new element that is manipulated 'by reference'. It is called
{{{unique}}} because the the created element can only appear one time in the page:
If it is added multiple times in a page, it will move from a place to another.

<<code language="ocaml"|
let _ = My_appl.register_service ~path:[] ~get_params:unit
  (fun () () ->
    let div = HTML5.M.unique HTML5.M.div [] in
    Eliom_services.onload {{
      Dom.appendChild
        (Eliom_client.Html5.of_div %div)
        (Dom_html.document##createTextNode(Js.string "some text"))
    }};
    Lwt.return
      (HTML5.M.html
         (HTML5.M.head (HTML5.M.title (HTML5.M.pcdata "title")) [])
         (HTML5.M.body [div])))
>>

Is the correct way to do this: the div in the page body will finally contain
{{{[div [pcdata "some text"]}}}.

References to unique elements are still valid after page change
( when not stopping the application ), and side effects on them are kept.

For example:
<<code language="ocaml"|
let div = HTML5.M.unique HTML5.M.div []

let s1 = My_appl.register_service ~path:["s1"] ~get_params:unit
  (fun () () ->
    Lwt.return
      (HTML5.M.html
         (HTML5.M.head (HTML5.M.title (HTML5.M.pcdata "s1")) [])
         (HTML5.M.body [div])))

let s2 = My_appl.register_service ~path:["s2"] ~get_params:unit
  (fun () () ->
    Eliom_services.onload {{
      Dom.appendChild
        (Eliom_client.Html5.of_div %div)
        (Dom_html.document##createTextNode(Js.string "some text"))
    }};
    Lwt.return
      (HTML5.M.html
         (HTML5.M.head (HTML5.M.title (HTML5.M.pcdata "s2")) [])
         (HTML5.M.body [
            Eliom_output.Html5.a ~service:s1 [HTML5.M.pcdata "change page to s1"] ();
            div])))
>>

When going direcly to the service s1, the page contains only a div element. But
if one goes to s2 then clicks on the link to go to s1, the unique {{{div}}}
element will still contains the text added to it in s2: its dom node is the
same on both pages.

Note that when you are defining some form input on server side for use with
client side script interraction, you almost always want to define it as unique.
For instance here
<<code language="ocaml"|
let input = HTML5.M.unique (HTML5.M.input ()) in

let read = HTML5.M.button
  ~a:[HTML5.M.a_onclick
         {{
           let input = Eliom_client.Html5.of_input %input in
           Dom_html.window##alert (input##value)
         }}
     ]
  [HTML5.M.pcdata "display input value"] in
>>
without unique a new input element would be created each time the button is clicked.

==== Unique Scripts

When a page is loaded all the script elements in the header are run. When
changing page without leaving the application, they are run another time if
they are still present. But is is not always the wanted behaviour. For
instance, if you use some javascript library, you don't want its code to be
executed multiple times. To achieve this, you have to declare those scripts
elements as unique.

<<code language="ocaml"|
let unique_script = HTML5.M.unique
  (HTML5.M.script (HTML5.M.cdata_script "alert(\"unique script\")"))
let non_unique_script = HTML5.M.script (HTML5.M.cdata_script "alert(\"non unique script\")")

let s =
  Eliom_services.service
    ~path:[]
    ~get_params:Eliom_parameters.unit
    ()

let _ = My_appl.register
  (fun () () ->
    Lwt.return
      (HTML5.M.html
         (HTML5.M.head (HTML5.M.title (HTML5.M.pcdata "s2"))
	   [unique_script;non_unique_script])
         (HTML5.M.body [
	   Eliom_output.Html5.a ~service:s [HTML5.M.pcdata "reload page"] ()])))
>>

On the first load of the page both messages {{{unique script}}} and
{{{non unique script}}} will be displayed and when clicking on the
"reload page" link, only {{{non unique script}}} will be displayed.
