= Scalability of Eliom apps

Here are a few hints on how to write scalable Eliom applications,
running on multiple cores or servers.

* Use an external load balancer that will route all the requests of
a same user agent to the same server (using cookies for example).
* Be careful with all global data (references,
dynamically created services ...).
* Use a distributed backend for Ocsipersist (postgresql for example), and disable persistent GC for all but one (by setting {{{<persistentsessiongcfrequency value="infinity" />}}}).
* If you are using
<<a_api project="eliom" subproject="server" | module Eliom_notif>> or
<<a_api project="ocsigen-start" | module Os_notif>>,
broadcast your notifications to all the servers.
