== Caching the data

Module <<a_api subproject="server"|module Eliom_cscache>>
implements a cache of data that can be used both for
keeping data on client side or keeping values in memory during a
request.

Have look at the documentation of this module for more information.

Also have a look to <<a_api project="ocsigenserver"|module Ocsigen_cache>>
for a local (client or server) cache that keeps the most recently used values.

== Off-line applications

In the near future, Eliom_cscache will make it possible to save persistent
data, which is useful for implementing off-line applications.
