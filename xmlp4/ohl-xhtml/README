XHTML is a O'Caml module for creating valid XHTML 1.1 (and XHTML 1.0)
documents.  The validity of the pages is guaranteed by the O'Caml type
system.  (NB: at the time of writing, forms support was not complete,
only basic forms are implemented.  Image maps are also not implemented
yet.)

XHTML can be used for creating static documents, but it is not the
most conventient way to key in text heavy documents.  Instead, it
should be most useful for database frontends etc.

XHTML is not a general XML processor that parses a DTD and checks the
validity of a document with respect to this DTD.  This lack in
flexibility is made up for by the ability to perform prove validity by
static type checking.

The implementation uses a XML module for generating well formed---but
not necessarily valid with respect to some DTD---XML documents.  The
elements of type XML.elt and attributes of type XML.attrib are then
hidden behind polymorphic phantom types type 'a elt = XML.elt and type
'a attrib = XML.attrib with 'a set to appropriate polymorphic
variants.

This approach can be adopted easily to other XML document types:
MathML and MusicML come to mind.
