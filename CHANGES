===== 2.2 (2012-06-02) =====

 The great renaming: Make Eliom's API more coherent

 * Dropped Eliom_pervasives, split into
 ** Eliom_lib (extension of stdlib)
 ** Eliom_content (content creation)

 * Moved all Html5,Xhtml content function to Eliom_content.{Html5,Xhtml}
 ** {HTML5,SVG,XHTML}.M -> Eliom_content.{Html5,Svg,Xhtml}.F
 ** {HTML5,SVG,XHTML}.DOM -> Eliom_content.{Html5,Svg,Xhtml}.D

 ** Eliom_parameters -> Eliom_parameter
 ** Eliom_references -> Eliom_reference
 ** Eliom_extensions -> Eliom_extension

 * Approximating compatibility module for Eliom 2.1: Eliom_compatibility_2_1

===== 2.1.1 (2012-03-20) =====

 * Server: Add Eliom references of scope site
 * Server: Add an non-Lwt interface to volatile Eliom references
 * Client: Add an option to restrict usage of XHR.
 * Bugfixes:
 ** Client: More robust and portable history handling
 ** Client: More robust CSS preloading (change_page)
 ** Client: Better compatibility with Opera

===== 2.1.0 (2012-02-24) =====

 * Page loading rewritten.
 ** We do not traverse the HTML tree anymore for retrieving links
   and putting events handlers, it use querySelectorAll instead.
   (with a fallback for older browsers)
 *** We do not send a sparse tree along the page anymore.
 *** It is faster and more resilient to ugly browser plugins
 ** Add css loading optimisations: It fetch the css included
    using @include with XHR before changing page and construct only
    one concatenated css. It avoids page blinking when the css change
    and is faster (browsers tend to render the page once per css).
 ** Unwrapping hand rewritten in js.
 ** And a lot of other optimisations.

 * Rework of unique nodes:
 ** Introduce new lightweight 'unique' node of scope request,
    a.k.a. DOM nodes: use it through HTML5.DOM.{div,...} or its alias
    HTML5.{div,...}.
 ** To create unique node of scope application, the function
    'HTML5.M.unique ?copy' has been renamed 'HTML5.create_global_elt
    ?id'
 ** Abstract id for application node are created with
    "HTML.new_global_elt_id"
 ** Node representation now differs between the client and the
    server. They are unwrapped on the client to simplify the XML
    representation: "unique" node that have already a "Javascript DOM
    representation" only contains a reference to the DOM
    representation.

 * Server API Changes:
 ** Add Eliom_state.get_*_session_group_size to know the number of
    session in a session group
 ** Parameters of type any can't be suffixes (semantic problem)
 ** Add Eliom_comet.wait_timeout to notify when a client isn't active
 ** Allow services to setup "Cache-policy: max-age" with Text, CssText and
    Files modules.
 ** Eliom_state.discard and discard_data now accept scope request.

 * Client API Changes:
 ** add an Eliom_dom module provinding imperative function on unique HTML5.elt.
    (for instance {{{appendChild: ?before:'a elt -> 'b elt -> 'c elt -> unit}}}).
 ** HTML5.M.a_on{click,...} functions directly expect a
    function as parameter (XML.event_handler_of_function isn't
    required anymore).
 ** Eliom_comet: configuration option for time until timeout after the focus is lost
 ** Handling wrapping of int32 type.
 ** Onload event handlers on HTML elements are executed when they are converted to
    DOM (using Eliom_client.of_ functions). This allows them to be added to nodes not
    sent in the page.
 ** Calls to {{{Eliom_services.onload}}} are taken into account for services sending
    caml values. The handlers are executed when the call to
    {{{Eliom_client.caml_call_service}}} terminates.

 * Eliom syntax:
 ** Event handlers can now access the current event using the _ev variable
    inside {{ ... }} typed according to the attribute.
 ** Allow modules to be used inside client expr {{ ... }} and client_expr
    {{ ... }} to be used inside modules
 ** Add -ppopt option to eliomc

 * And a lot of bugfixes.

===== 2.0.2 (2001-11-30) =====

 * Compatibility with js_of_ocaml-1.0.8 and tyxml-2.0.1
 * API Changes:
 ** Eliom_output.Redirection: use 302 as default and introduce
    abstract nome for all the 30x HTTP code
 ** Eliom_output.Customize: remove unrequired Functor parameters.
 * Delayed URl computation: this allows relative links to be created
   outside of service handler.
 * Client: do not ignore "onload" events attached on Dom elements
   other than window.
 * Bugfixes:
 ** Client: do not execute change_page_uri when the middle button or
    any modifier key is pressed.
 ** Client: update correctly the location when changing page with
    forms.
 ** Server: displaying better dynlink error messages.
 ** Syntax extension: avoid infinite loop while parsing first-order
    module expression
 ** Eliom_parameters: fixing wrong parameter names for list of list
 ** Eliom_parameters: fixing bug causing stack overflow when lists
    parameter names were wrong
 ** Fixing bug with non-localized parameters and service not keeping
    non-attached params
 ** Eliom_comet: stateless channels can be registered multiple times
    (close #220)

    (all recent version we tested), Safari 5, Opera (tested 11.51), Internet
    explorer (9, ie 8 almost work)
 ** in forms declared outside of the sp's scope, hrefs were incorrect:
    url calculation is now done for each request
 ** the function {{{Eliom_client.caml_call_service}}} was broken with some kind
    of services
 ** application cookies are now always sent
 ** fix incorrect sharing of type variables in the syntax extension (thanks to
    William Le Ferrand)
 ** 404 and 403 errors are not dropped by applications anymore (This fix is
    partial: when the page content is application content, this still does not
    work when an exception handler returns something else)
 ** Fix problems with url generation for non-attached coservices inside an
    application
 ** tail recursive marshalling and demarshalling: no more limit on the depth of
    data sent along the page
 ** Fix problems with redirection and action with `NoReload exiting the application
 ** Handle correctly 204 code in application (do nothing with change page, fail
    with caml_call_service)
 ** Fix escape character '>': problem with strings containing "]]>"

    non-eliom application services
  * Stateless implementation of comet channels

    in HTML5 format. (first answers were in HTML5 subsequent were marshalled
    caml tree)
  * XML representation is now shared by client and server: conversion to
    Dom nodes is made by Eliom_client.Html5.of_ functions
  * Remove the need for an application container: application pages are
    now classical HTML5 pages.
  * Add Eliom_pervasives.{HTML5/XML/SVG}.unique function to declare XML node
    handled "by reference"

  * {{{<select>}}} in forms, by Stéphane Dalmas
  * EXPERIMENTAL: The Web server is now extensible. It means that you
    can add modules (like Apache modules) for generating pages,
    filters of requests, extensions of config files. For now there are
    two modules, one for static pages, and one for dynamic pages. The
    only changes for users is that they need to dynlink staticmod.cmo
    and ocsigenmod.cma from the configuration file. The syntax of
    config file for modules and staticdir also changed.
  * It is now possible to specify the encoding of characters for each
    sub-site.

    time. Practically, add {{{Lwt.return}}} before the page you want
    to send, and use cooperative input/output functions.
  * Typing errors of parameters are now catchable.
  * {{{static_dir}}} is now a function
  * Most of global references have been removed. You now need to give
    sp as parameter to {{{register_for_session}}}, {{{static_dir}}},

    libraries ({{{detach}}} function).
  * EXPERIMENTAL: The {{{Ocsigen}}} module now contains a functor
    {{{Make}}} to allows the use of several ways of generating
    XHTML. The default way (using {{{XHTML.M}}} or the syntax

    also an untyped xhtml generation module called {{{Ocsigen.Text}}}.
