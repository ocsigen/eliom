(** Broadcasting facilities between clients and server *)

(** {b Please read the
    {% <<a_manual chapter="clientserver-communication" | chapter on
    communication >>%} of Eliom's manual
    before this page to learn how client and server parts communicate. }
 *)

(** The type of bus's carrying values of type ['a]. Bus's are values
    that can be easily shared among clients. Each of these clients
    along with the server can send a value on the bus. Values can be
    received by each of the participants as a stream. Note that no
    effort is put to order message receptions on the different
    participants. *)
type ('a, 'b) t

(** [create ?scope ?name ?size ?filter t] creates a fresh bus.
    The [scope] parameter
    is used to chose the kind of channel on which the bus rely
    (See [Eliom_comet.create] for more information). The [?name] argument
    allow one to make bus's persistent over server restart. The [size]
    argument behaves like the one on {!Eliom_comet.Channel.create}.
    If [?filter] argument is present, data is filtered through this function
    before entering the bus. Use this for example if you want to add
    some information, like IP address, or user id.
*)
val create :
  ?scope:[< Eliom_comet.Channel.comet_scope ] -> ?name:string -> ?size:int
  -> 'a Deriving_Json.t
  -> ('a, 'a) t

(** Same as [create], but data is filtered through [filter] function
    before entering the bus. Use this for example if you want to add
    some information, like IP address, or user id.
*)
val create_filtered :
  ?scope:[< Eliom_comet.Channel.comet_scope ] -> ?name:string -> ?size:int
  -> filter:('a -> 'b Lwt.t)
  -> 'a Deriving_Json.t
  -> ('a, 'b) t

(** [stream b] returns the stream of data sent to bus [b]. Notice you
    sould not use that function multiple times on the same bus, it will
    return the same stream. If you want to receive multiple times the
    same data, you sould copy the stream with [Lwt_stream.clone] *)
val stream : ('a, 'b) t -> 'b Lwt_stream.t

(** [write b x] sends the value [x] on the bus [b]. Every participant,
    including the server, will receive [x]. *)
val write : ('a, 'b) t -> 'a -> unit Lwt.t
