(** {2 Server side state data, a.k.a Eliom references} *)

(** {b Please read the
    {% <<a_manual chapter="server-state" | Eliom manual >>%}
    before this page to learn how server side state works. }

*)


(** Eliom references come in two flavors: they may be stored persistently or
    the may be volatile.  The module [Volatile] allows creation of
    references which can be, get, set, modify, and unset volatile references
    through {e non-Lwt} functions. *)
type ('a, +'storage) eref'

(** The type of Eliom references whose content is of type ['a].  *)
type 'a eref = ('a, [ `Volatile | `Persistent ]) eref'

(** Exception raised when trying to access an eref
    that has not been initaliazed, when we don't want to initialize it. *)
exception Eref_not_initialized

(** The function [eref ~scope value] creates an Eliom reference for
    the given [scope] and initialize it with [value]. See the Eliom
    manual for more information about {% <<a_manual
    chapter="server-state"|scopes>>%}.

    Use the optional parameter [?persistent] if you want the data to
    survive after relaunching the server. You must give an unique name
    to the table in which it will be stored on the hard disk (using
    Ocsipersist).  Be very careful to use unique names, and to change
    the name if you change the type of the data, otherwise the server
    may crash (unsafe unmarshaling). This parameter has no effect for
    scope {!Eliom_common.request_scope}.

    Use the optional parameter [~secure:true] if you want the data to
    be available only using HTTPS. This parameter has no effect for
    scopes {!Eliom_common.global_scope}, {!Eliom_common.site_scope}, and
    {!Eliom_common.request_scope}. The default is [false], but this default
    can be changed in configuration file ([<securecookies value="true"/>]).
    This option can be placed as global Eliom option (inside the [<extension>]
    tag which is loading Eliom), or in the local configuration of one site
    (inside the [<eliom>] tag). But in the latter case,
    it will only have effect on the actions performed after in the same [<site>]
    (and NOT on the top-level instructions of the modules loaded before).

    {e Warning: Eliom references of scope {!Eliom_common.global_scope},
    {!Eliom_common.site_scope} or
    {!Eliom_common.request_scope} may be created at any time ; but for other
    scopes, they must be created when the site information is
    available to Eliom, that is, either during the initialization
    phase of the server (while reading the configuration file) or
    during a request. Otherwise, it will raise the exception
    {!Eliom_common.Eliom_site_information_not_available}. If you are
    using static linking, you must delay the call to this function
    until the configuration file is read, using
    {!Eliom_service.register_eliom_module}. Otherwise you will also
    get this exception.}

    {e creating the initial content} is provided (cf. also {!Lazy.from_fun}).

    In each scope, the function [f] is called for creating the value of the
    reference the first time the reference is read (by {!Eliom_reference.get}),
