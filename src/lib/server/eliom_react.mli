(** Propagate events
    occurrences from the server to the client and the other way
    around. Occurrence propagation is done asynchronously.

    Warning: it is not possible to catch exceptions on each channel
    using Eliom_react (for example channel closed or full).
    If you need an error handling, use Eliom_comet.Channel instead.
*)

(** {b Please read the
    {% <<a_manual chapter="clientserver-communication" | chapter on
    communication >>%} of Eliom's manual
    before this page to learn how client and server parts communicate. }

    The use of this module is pretty much useless without it's client counter
    part.

(** Event from server to client. *)
module Down : sig
  (** A "Down event" (AKA down-going event) is an event which occurrences are
      transmitted asynchronously to the client. Even if they are named "events",
      it might be better to consider them as asynchronous server-to-client
      edges in the react events dependency graph.

      To use this, call function [of_react] on server side,
      and just use the returned value as a react event on client side.
      Example:
      [let e = of_react ... in ... {{ ... React.E.map f %e; ... }}]
 *)

  (** The abstract type of down events. *)
  type 'a t

  (** [of_react ?scope ?throttling ?name e] create an
      asynchronous edge originating from [e]. The parameters are:
      - [throttling]
      for the limit to event propagation rate (minimum time, in second,
      between two consecutive events - other events are lost),
      - [name] for named edges,
      - [size] for the size of the server side buffer.
      - [scope]
      tell which kind of channel this rely on (See [Eliom_comet.create]). *)

(** Event from client to server. *)
module Up :
sig
  (** Up events are quite different from Down events. Because of the
      asymmetrical nature of web programming and because of the reactive model
      used, an Up event must be created on the server and wrapped into a
      callback (or something the client can build a callback with).

      Example of use:
      [let e_up = Eliom_react.Up.create
        (Eliom_parameter.ocaml "a" [%derive.json: string])
      in
      ... {{ ignore ( %e_up "A") }} ...
      ]
    *)

  (** The type of events that, while being "on the server", are triggered by
      clients. On the server such an event is /primitive/ (hence the [create]
      function) whereas it is /effect-full/ on the client. *)
  type 'a t

  (** [to_react e] injects the up events [e] into react events so that it can
      be manipulated as a standard event. *)
  val to_react : 'a t -> 'a React.E.t

  (** [create param] creates an Up event.
      If [~name] is present, the coservice used to transmit the event will
      always have the same name, even if the server is restarted.
      [~scope] describes the visibility of the event. By default, it is
      [`Site] if it is called during initialisation,
      [`Client_process] otherwise.
