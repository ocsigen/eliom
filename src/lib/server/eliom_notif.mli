(** Server to client notifications.

    This module makes it possible for client side applications to be
    notified of changes on some indexed data (resources) on the server.

    Apply functor [Make] or [Make_Simple] for each type of data you want to be
    able to listen on. Each client starts listening on one piece of data by
    calling function [listen] with the index of that piece of data as parameter.
    Client stops listening by calling function [unlisten], or when the client
    side state is closed (by timeout or when the client disconnects for
    example).

    When the data is modified on server side, call function [notify]
    with the index of the data, and all clients listening to that piece
    of data will receive a notification.

    The functor will also create a client side react signal that will
    be updated every time the client is notified.

    See module Os_notif in Ocsigen Start for an example of use.

(** Signature of the functors [Eliom_notif.Make] and [Eliom_notif.Make_Simple].

    [S] has two types of notifications ([server_notif] and [client_notif])
    because we might need to serialise and deserialise the notification twice
    (in case of a multi-server set-up). Once for broadcasting it to other
    servers and once for transferring it to the client (after possibly
    transforming the message using information which is only locally available
    (see [prepare] below).

      from another. Typically it will be a user, but it could also for
      instance be a chat window. *)

  (** Initialise the notification module for the current client. This function
      needs to be called before using most other functions of this module. It
      isn't called implicitely during module instantiation because it relies on
      identity data which might not be available yet. *)

  (** Stop listening on data [key] *)

  (** Make a listener stop listening on data [key].
      If this function is called during a request it will be able to determine
      [sitedata] by itself, otherwise it needs to be supplied by the caller. *)

      listening on data referenced by [key].

      If [~notfor] is [`Me], notification will not be sent to the tab currently
      doing the request (the one which caused the notification to happen).
      Note that if [notify] is called with [~notfor:`Me] outside of a request it
      will fail. If it is [`Id id] it won't be sent to the destination defined
      by [id].

  (** Returns the client react event. Map a function on this event to react

      let%server something some_stuff =

           [%client

                ~%(Notif_module.client_ev ())

(** Use this functor if you need to customise your notifications with
    client-specific data (or block notifications for specific clients).
    This is made to work specifically in a multi-server set-up as well, where
    In a multi-server set-up notifications might need to be serialised twice,
    once before broadcasting them to the other servers (without client
    information present), and then once more to forward them to the clients
    possibly augmenting it with client-specific data or block for specific
    clients; see [ARG.prepare].

    Note: The communication between servers is not implemented in this module.
    To `plug in' your method of transporting notifications between servers you
    can override [S.notify]. See the manual for an example (coming soon).
