    stream is created each time this function is called. Some messages
    from the bus can be lost if they were sent before the call to
    [stream]. If you need to receive every message, use original stream
    instead. *)

(** [stream b] returns the stream of data sent to bus [b]. A new
    stream is created each time this function is called. Every
    messages sent to the bus after the generation of the page are
    received. This function can be called only in the onload event
    handler, if called outside, it will raise a Failure. *)

    bus, but it is still possible to write to the bus. It is also
    possible to close the bus by canceling a thread reading on the
    stream. *)

    messages that are accumulated before forcing a flush.

(** [set_time_before_flush bus time] set the maximum time to wait for
    a new message to enqueue before flushing. Set this to a small
    value to make your app more responsive, but remember that it will
    consume more bandwidth. default is 0.05 second. *)
