(** The type of hierarchical sites.
    A hierarchical site is a pair (main page, subpages).

    The difference between
    [Main_page], [Default_page] and [Not_clickable] is a bit subtle:

    - [Main_page] is when you want to create a main page for your
    subsite. All the subpages are subsections of that page.

    - [Default_page] is like [Main_page] but is not taken into account
    for computing which is the current page in the menu.
    Use it for example when there is no main page, but you want
    one of the subpages to be the default page for your subsite.
    The service you use as default page
    must appear another time in the subtree!

    - [Not_clickable] is when you do not want the menu entry to be a link
    but you want subpages.

    Each subpage is defined by the text to be displayed in menus
    and a [hierarchical_site_item].
    If the latter is [Disabled], the menu entry is disabled.
